This crate provides data types for the [ASAM OpenDRIVE](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/) standard.
Currently, version `1.7.0` is supported. 

See the [very basic example](https://github.com/itdesigners/opendrive-rs/blob/master/examples/inout.rs) for a brief usage introductoin.

### cargo features

 - `workaround-sumo-issue-10301`: OpenDRIVE files generated by sumo might lack required `paramPoly3.pRange` values, assume `ParamPoly3pRange::Normalized` while parsing, see https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/issues/10301
 - `workaround-sumo-roadmark-missing-color`: OpenDRIVE files generated by sumo might lack required `roadmark.color`, assume `Color::Standard` while parsing
 - `workaround-sumo`: Enable all parser workarounds related to SUMO
 - `fuzzing`: Load dependency `arbitrary` for fuzzing 

This crate might or might not be developed further as the need for more API calls arise.
That said, (small!) pull-requests are welcome.
